## Active Context: TaskMate Enhancement Sprint - Notifications, Filtering, and UX

### Current Sprint Goals

This sprint focuses on improving TaskMate's user experience by enhancing notifications, enabling more granular task filtering, and addressing key UX pain points identified in user feedback. Specifically, we aim to:

*   **Implement push notifications:** Allow users to receive real-time updates on task assignments, due dates, and status changes.
*   **Refine task filtering:** Provide advanced filtering options based on priority, status, assignee, and custom tags.
*   **Improve task creation flow:** Streamline the task creation process, making it more intuitive and efficient.
*   **Address performance issues:** Optimize the application for faster loading times and smoother transitions.

### Ongoing Tasks

*   **Notification Service Implementation (Backend):** Integrating Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications. Status: In Progress (75% complete). Expected completion: June 5th. Assignee: David.
*   **Task Filter Component Development (Frontend):** Developing the UI and logic for advanced task filtering. Status: In Progress (50% complete). Expected completion: June 7th. Assignee: Sarah.
*   **Task Creation Flow Redesign (Frontend):** Implementing the redesigned task creation form based on the latest mockups. Status: In Progress (25% complete). Expected completion: June 9th. Assignee: Maria.
*   **Database Optimization (Backend):** Optimizing database queries to improve application performance. Status: In Progress (60% complete). Expected completion: June 6th. Assignee: John.
*   **Notification Testing and Validation (QA):** Testing the notification service on various devices and platforms. Status: Not Started. Expected start date: June 5th. Assignee: Emily.

### Known Issues

*   **Notification Delivery Delays (Android):** Some users are experiencing delays in receiving push notifications on Android devices. Investigation ongoing.
*   **Filter Performance with Large Datasets:** The filtering component experiences performance issues when applied to very large task lists (over 500 tasks). Optimization efforts are underway.
*   **UI Bug in Task Edit Screen (iOS):** A minor UI bug is present in the task edit screen on iOS devices, causing overlapping elements.

### Priorities

1.  **Notification Service Implementation (Backend):** Critical for delivering real-time updates to users.
2.  **Task Filter Component Development (Frontend):** Essential for improving task management efficiency.
3.  **Database Optimization (Backend):** Addresses performance concerns and ensures scalability.
4.  **Task Creation Flow Redesign (Frontend):** Improves user experience and task creation efficiency.
5.  **Notification Testing and Validation (QA):** Ensures the reliability and functionality of the notification service.
6.  **Addressing Known Issues:** Resolving existing bugs and performance problems to enhance user experience.

### Next Steps

*   **Complete FCM integration:** Finalize the integration of Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications.
*   **Begin QA testing of notification service:** Start testing the notification service on various devices and platforms.
*   **Address notification delivery delays:** Investigate and resolve the issue of delayed notifications on Android devices.
*   **Continue development of task filter component:** Continue building the UI and logic for advanced task filtering.
*   **Refactor database queries:** Refactor database queries to improve application performance and scalability.
*   **Implement UI fixes for iOS:** Resolve the UI bug in the task edit screen on iOS devices.

### Meeting Notes (May 30, 2025)

*   **Topic:** Sprint Review and Planning
*   **Attendees:** David, Sarah, Maria, John, Emily, Project Manager (Lisa)
*   **Key Discussion Points:**
    *   David reported progress on FCM integration, highlighting a potential issue with rate limiting. He will investigate further.
    *   Sarah demonstrated the initial prototype of the task filter component. Feedback was provided on the UI design and filter options.
    *   Maria presented the redesigned task creation flow. The team agreed to simplify the form further by removing non-essential fields.
    *   John discussed database optimization efforts and proposed a new indexing strategy.
    *   Emily outlined the testing plan for the notification service and requested access to the staging environment.
*   **Action Items:**
    *   David: Investigate FCM rate limiting issue.
    *   Sarah: Revise UI design of task filter component based on feedback.
    *   Maria: Simplify the task creation form by removing non-essential fields.
    *   John: Implement the proposed database indexing strategy.
    *   Emily: Gain access to the staging environment for notification testing.
